Shows distance between sets of cartesian coordinates, assuming origin is the top left, and each unit is 5 feet.

`!distance [x1y1] [x2y2] [z]`

If only `x1y1` is provided, it assumes origin is `A1`.
If `z` is provided, it accounts for vertical height." 
-f "`!map` Support|If you have your initiative set up with the `!map` alias, you can target combatants using this alias instead of just raw coordinates.
`!distance [target|x1y1] [target2|x2y2] [z]` - If only one argument is provided, and it is a combatant, it will attempt to grab the location of either the users active character in initiative, or whoevers turn it is in init. You can intermix coordinates and targets.
