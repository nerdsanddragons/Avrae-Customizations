Used for spending bullets when making attacks. Uses a Custom Countera, `Bullets`, in order to track your current bullet count.

If you're using multiple `-t` targets, or `-rr #` in order to make multiple attacks in one command, simply use the snippet more than once. 
Example: `!attack revolver -t Tiamat -rr 3 bullet bullet bullet`

If you would like to add or remove arrows to your 'bullet pouch', simply use `!cc Bullets +#` or `!cc Bullets -#`
