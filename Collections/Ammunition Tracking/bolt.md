Used for spending bolts when making attacks. Uses two Custom Counters, `Bolts` and `Used Bolts`, in order to track your current bolt count as well as how many you've used for the `!collect` alias.

If you're using multiple `-t` targets, or `-rr #` in order to make multiple attacks in one command, simply use the snippet more than once. 
Example: `!attack crossbow -t Tiamat -rr 3 bolt bolt bolt`

If you would like to add or remove arrows to your 'quiver', simply use `!cc Bolts +#` or `!cc Bolts -#`
