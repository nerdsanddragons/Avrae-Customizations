This alias is for copying `!use` codes out of your available resources so that you can make your own custom names for them instead of having to use the full given name. 

It falls on you to make sure you're not doubling up on anything or naming anything a name already used by something else. To "rename" a code, use `!usenamer <code> <desired_name>`. Remember that cvar names must be identifiers (only contain a-z, A-Z, 0-9, _, and not start with a number).
