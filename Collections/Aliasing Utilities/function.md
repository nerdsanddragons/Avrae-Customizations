`!function [search]` to look up a function.
If multiple similar, aim for an exact match.

This alias is for searching up functions and methods for use in Draconic. As a note, even if a method (and some functions) aren't actually in this alias or on the linked [ReadTheDocs](https://avrae.readthedocs.io/en/latest/aliasing/api.html), does not mean that it is unavailable in Draconic. Most `str`, `int`, `dict`, `list`, `set`, and `tuple` (among others) methods are still available (with the noticeable exception of `str.format()` and `str.format_map()`, which are disabled for security reasons. That means you can still do your `str.join()`  or `dict.items()`. Listing every available option in Python would be futile and redundant.
