I would humbly like to ***RAAAAAGE***

`!rage` - Will start a rage on your active character, using your Rage or Rages counter. If you're in initiative, will add an effect to you, granting resistances and damage bonus.

**Parameters**

`-i` - Ignore requirements, does not use a counter.
`-t <target>` - Will start a rage on the target.
`dex` or `nodmg` - Won't apply the `-d` damage bonus. Useful for dex barbs.

**Notes for Bear Totem Barbarians**
In order for this alias to detect that you are a Totem Barbarian, with your level 3 totem set as Bear, you will need to do `!cvar l3totem Bear`. After you do this, the alias will apply the appropriate resistances.
