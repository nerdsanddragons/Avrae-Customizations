For the Sorcerer ability Font of Magic.

To create a Spell Slot, using your Sorcery Points:
`!font <+|create> #`

To spend a Spell Slot, to create Sorcery Points:
`!font <-|spend> #`

Unfortunately, there's no good way for me to support creating more spell slots than your sheet currently has available. To do so, I recommend subtracting the counter yourself (`!cc sorcery -#`), and casting the spell with `-l # -i` (`!cast fireball -l 7 -i`) so it doesn't use a slot.
