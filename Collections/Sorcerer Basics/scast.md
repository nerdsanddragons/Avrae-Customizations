Allows the user to cast spells and use meta magic appropriately. 

`!scast <"spell name"> [args]`

For Careful and Heightened meta magic, use target specific args. 
For example: `-t or1|pass careful`, or `-t or2|dis heighten`

For Empowered, you'll need to reroll and apply the difference in damage separately, sorry.

For Elemental, change the damage type with `-dtype`
For example: `-dtype fire elemental` or `-dtype lightning elemental`

There is currently no support for homebrew spells.
